## Transactions parsing
Best practice and common sense is to enter all your business expenses once a year, all of them at once. The process is pretty painful, so I wrote some scripts to parse my bank statements and assign expense categories based on vendor names. Jupyter, Python, Pandas, OpenAI... nothing crazy but fun.
